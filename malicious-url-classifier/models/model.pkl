The file `models/model.pkl` is a binary file that contains the trained SVM model. It cannot be generated as text content. Instead, this file will be created when you run the `src/train_model.py` script, which trains the model and saves it to this location.

To summarize, the contents of `models/model.pkl` will be generated by executing the training script, and it will not contain any human-readable text.
